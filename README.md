# Software Design Patterns (SDP) - Course Assignments

This repository contains course assignments for the Software Design Patterns (SDP) course. Each assignment focuses on implementing and understanding different design patterns.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Singleton Pattern

In this assignment, we explore the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In this assignment, you'll learn how to implement the Singleton pattern and understand its use cases.

- Assignment 1 folder: [Assignment 1 - Singleton Pattern](Assignment%201/SDP-Assignment1)

### Assignment 2: Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. In Assignment 2, you'll dive into the Abstract Factory pattern, its implementation, and its role in creating complex object structures.

### Assignment 3: Factory Method Pattern

In Assignment 3, you will delve into the Factory Method design pattern, a creational pattern that offers an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses to define the type of objects to be created. The Factory Method pattern encourages loose coupling between creators and their product objects, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

### Assignment 4: State Pattern

In Assignment 4, you will explore the State design pattern. The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object undergoes different operations based on its current state.

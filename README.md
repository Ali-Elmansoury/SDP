# Software Design Patterns (SDP) - Course Assignments

This repository contains course assignments for the Software Design Patterns (SDP) course. Each assignment focuses on implementing and understanding different design patterns.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Singleton Pattern

In this assignment, we explore the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In this assignment, you'll learn how to implement the Singleton pattern and understand its use cases.

### Assignment 2: Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. In Assignment 2, you'll dive into the Abstract Factory pattern, its implementation, and its role in creating complex object structures.
